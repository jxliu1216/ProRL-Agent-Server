# Gateway Service

`polar.gateway` is the per-worker FastAPI service that runs a session. It accepts
a dispatch from the rollout server, prepares a runtime, runs the agent harness,
**transparently proxies the agent's LLM calls** to a local inference server
(capturing every one), then builds and evaluates a trajectory and reports the
result back.

## Mental model

The agent never knows Polar is in the middle. Before running it, the gateway
injects proxy endpoints as environment variables — `OPENAI_BASE_URL`,
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_API_URL`, with the **API key set to the session
id**. The agent thinks it's calling OpenAI/Anthropic/Google, but every request
lands on the gateway's catch-all route, which:

1. **detects** the API family from the path/headers/body (`detection.py`),
2. **transforms** the request to the served model and adds training fields
   (`transform/`),
3. forwards it to the configured inference server (`engine.py` handles
   SGLang/vLLM specifics),
4. **captures** the request + response as a completion record, and
5. transforms the response back into the shape the agent expects.

Streaming is **synthetic**: even when the agent asks for a token stream, the
gateway makes one non-streaming backend call and replays the full answer as
well-formed SSE — simpler, and enough for capture.

A session moves through staged worker pools: **INIT** (start runtime + run the
prepare recipe) → **READY** (wait for a run slot) → **RUNNING** (harness setup +
run) → **POST-RUN** (build trajectory, evaluate, tear down, call back). Terminal
statuses are `COMPLETED`, `ERROR`, or `TIMEOUT`.

## Main files

- `server.py`: the FastAPI app — the catch-all LLM proxy route, the
  session/admin/health/events endpoints, and synthetic streaming.
- `node.py`: `GatewayNodeManager` — stage handlers, runtime prepare, trajectory
  build + eval, rollout registration/heartbeat, result callback, and the agent
  env injection.
- `dispatcher.py`: stage-isolated worker pools and the
  INIT→READY→RUNNING→POST-RUN transitions.
- `session.py`: in-memory session registry, id validation, and resolving the
  session id from an incoming proxied request.
- `detection.py`: API-family detection (`anthropic` / `openai_chat` /
  `openai_responses` / `google`).
- `transform/`: per-API request/response transformers (see
  [transform](transform/README.md)).
- `engine.py`: inference-backend strategy (SGLang / vLLM) — injects
  token-id/logprob params and canonicalizes responses.
- `proxy.py`: `InferenceClient`, the HTTP client to the inference server, with
  pause/resume generation gating.
- `storage.py`: in-memory completion-record store (the authoritative copy).
- `completion_writer.py`: background task that persists completions to disk off
  the hot path.

## What it captures

Each proxied call is stored as a `CompletionRecord` that keeps both the agent's
original request and the served request, plus the response. Records live in
memory (used to build the trajectory) and, when `gateway.completion_persistence`
is enabled, are also written to
`<save_dir>/task_<id>/sessions/<sid>/completions/<NNNN>-<id>.json`.

## Pause and resume

`POST /admin/inference/pause` and `/resume` gate the gateway's **outbound
generation** (the calls in `InferenceClient`). A training bridge pauses new
generation while it syncs weights, lets in-flight calls drain, then resumes —
this pauses inference, not the gateway process.
